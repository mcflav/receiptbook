This is a single page applicaton created in Angular. It's for small business owners and allows them to handle their business receipts paperless. All receipts can be viewed by the user and their accountant via the single page application. It uses TD-forms (template driven). 
I created the backend database using Node.js and deployed the project to Heroku using a MongoDB database.
